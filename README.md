## Description/Purpose

This simple application was designed to help developers add a markdown formatted Table of Contents generator to their documentation.

## How To Use

This application is in its very early stages, and is probably prone to some bugs. Right now it works on a very specific setup for your documentation to be valid for it to parse. The `#` level heading is reserved for the very top-level of your documentation. Otherwise, the parser will generate nested links for each level of your documentation from top to bottom, starting with `##` and ending with `######`.

## Issues

If you experience bugs or other bad behavior, please feel free to open up an issue!
